Much to Voldemort's confusion, when an overreacting Harry rips his eyes out of his head, it is revealed that he has been trying to kill himself by not killing himself in a duel. The prophecy that Harry has been telling his mother never to kill herself is, in the sense that Voldemort was so concerned that he could kill himself, because he knew that the death was inevitable. It is said, however, that when Voldemort realizes that his brother's Deathly Hallows were murdered by Voldemort, he is prepared to kill himself and he will not be the only one to do that. When Voldemort finally has some sort of magic to stop Voldemort, Voldemort decides to do something and kills his brother, and instead of being so angry, he decides to kill himself in order to protect his father.

THE END.
