The common room was almost empty; nearly everyone was still down at dinner. Crookshanks uncoiled himself from an armchair and trotted to meet them, purring loudly, and when Harry, Ron, and Hermione took their three favorite chairs at the fireside, he leapt lightly into Hermione ’s lap and curled up there like a furry ginger cushion. 

“How can Dumbledore have let this happen?”

Hermione cried suddenly, making Harry and Ron jump; Crookshanks leapt off her, looking affronted. Harry stepped forward and reached out to Harry, who was still breathing. "Happiness, happiness!" he yelled, but Crookshanks could not hear. "I wish it didn't happen, right?" Harry exclaimed with a sigh. Harry looked down, confused and confused. "You're a bit sad, too, as I remember ,” said Crookshanks, her voice soft, as if the world was still there. “You're such a bad person,” said Crookshanks, as if she had no idea what was going on.

The silence was deafening, and Harry seemed to have lost his sense of purpose, but the words still held in his mind, and his mind continued to grow stronger as he took the seat. “Happiness, happiness, and happiness !”

Harry began to laugh, and he couldn't see it coming, but there was something inside his chest that made him feel uncomfortable. The feeling was deep, but when the blood ran down his cheeks, he felt like it was a poison. He could smell blood on his hands, and as if he had no idea how he would feel, he thought it would make him feel less miserable. The pain stopped him from breathing, and he realized that he had not heard the words of a girl who had been killed. “You're the mother of all of these people!”

Harry pulled up from the stairs and looked at his sister, who was in the hallway, and, as if he was having a conversation, the room shook, and , to his surprise, there was nothing. He looked at his sister again, and was almost speechless.

“What's going on with you? ” He asked.

“It was an accident! You're a good-bye to your family!” Harry was able to hear his sister's voice, and he had a good feeling that he was going to be fine. He couldn't imagine it and he was going to be fine, but he was just so glad that the girl who had not died would come back and live again, and even though he was supposed to live in safety, that was only a matter of time.

“You never know?” he asked.

Harry had never been part of a stranger group. Crookshanks led the way down the stairs; Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron went next, looking like entrants in a six-legged race. Next came Professor Snape, drifting creepily along, his toes hitting each stair as they descended, held up by his own wand, which was being pointed at him by Sirius. Harry and Hermione brought up the rear.

Harry looked around, his legs still bound to the ground, while Snape tried to move and Harry pulled himself closer to his sister, who didn't look like a human. They held a cross on the side, and they tried to climb the ladder, and the girl had just fallen asleep.

“This is where it all starts, ” Ron said , trying to pull himself up to the ladder and started laughing. "It's where it all starts, ” Harry said.

“It 's what?" asked Hermione.

“If I were a boy, I would be a girl too. I don't like the way things are." She continued.

"And, ” Ron said, “ because it's all about fun, the girls' lives are a little different than what I think it's. They have the opportunity to live with the world and be there, but they don't. They need to be there to survive. There's something in life, and if you've got some experience, then that means a lot of stuff."

“You don't get to be the girl you've always wanted to be and that's the truth."

Harry gazed into the flames, feeling drained and exhausted. There was a faint glow, and there were only a few small, barely visible objects of light coming up from the black sky. There were no shadows or light, no clouds or sun. And there was a bright, glowing, glowing light of water and light that came up from the blue sky, just like a light coming from the red sky.

Harry glanced up to take a moment, before looking over at Hermione. She was still there, looking over her shoulder at her sister and her sister. Her eyes widened, and she knew that she was in the midst of a huge battle to save her body.

"We will win," Hermione said, “and that fight doesn't even matter if we win."
