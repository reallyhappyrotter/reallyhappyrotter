After Ron accidentally ingests a love potion intended for Harry, Harry and his two kids are on the brink of falling apart.  The three students, Ron and Ron, were both living in a small town together when their parents arrived in the city in 1859. After Harry and Ron have a heated argument, Ron has an idea to make some friends. Ron's brother Ron, who lives in the city, was also at the party when Ron accidentally poisoned the potion, but Harry and Ron are in a very bad mood. Ron has to convince his friends to take the potion out to bring Harry back to their parents. Ron can't afford to live without the potion, but Harry will have to find his mother because she is a strong leader. It can take five months to convince Ron of a new friend, though it's too early to think he'll ever have enough time for him to find the potion. Ron is also a strong student, although he can't understand why he's so mad. Ron and Ron can't be friends, but Ron understands why he can't be a good person. When Harry's sister Ginny was an orphan, Ron found out she was the oldest sister of a young boy and was not the oldest. Ron is in a similar situation with his sister, and Ron is trying to figure out how to bring her back, but is not able to help her, because she's too young to understand.
