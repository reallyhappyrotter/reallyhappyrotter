This is what happens when you translate and keep on re-translating Botnik's "The Handsome One" about 10-15 times in various languages using Google Translate and then turn it back into English.

The lands of the palace were shaken by magical lands. Outside there was a huge black roof filled 
with blood in the sky. The only sound in Hagrid's booth was her furniture collapsing. Magic: Harry 
Potter loved it. As he walked into the arena towards the castle, Harry's past was shaken by a sheet. 
Ron was standing there doing a kind of frantic dance. He saw Harry and immediately started eating 
Hermione's family. Ron's shirt was Ron's bad. Hermione Reasoning admits: "If the two of you can't 
come together happily, I'll be aggressive." "What about Ron's magic?" Ron was a tall, slow and quiet 
bird for the Rune Show Harry. Harry didn't want to think of birds. "Death on the top of the castle!" 
Rune, trembling Ron was going to be a spider. I was not proud of him, but it was difficult to spread 
the spider in his body, which was said and done. "Look," Hermione said. "Apparently there are a lot 
of assassins in the palace. Let's listen to their meetings." The three friends jumped from the roof of 
the palace to get out. They almost give him a leg, but the wizard doesn't climb. Ron looked at the 
button and then at Hermin with great pain. "I think it's closed," he said. "Off," Mr. The ghost in his 
shabby costume, Sturkis said. He looked at the door and shouted how it was closed and asked for a 
small ball in its place. The password was "woman of flesh," shouted Hermione. Harry, Ron, and 
Hermione stood quietly behind the seemingly evil death circle. Death Eater said: "I'll be fine if you 
love me." The other replied, "Thank you very much." The confidence born of death nodded to kiss 
her on the cheek. "Oh well!" The latter said and his friend rejoined. All the other death killers were 
humbly beaten. It then took them a few minutes to review Harry's plan to get rid of the magic. Harry 
realizes that Voldemort is standing behind him. He made a huge impact. Harry rolled his eyes and 
threw them into the woods. Voldemort looked up at Harry, who couldn't see anything at the 
moment. Harry said very badly: "Voldemort, you are a moderate and clear love." Hermione shook 
her head. She was a tall death eater wearing a T-shirt with the words "Hermione forgot how to 
dance", so Hermione dipped her face into the mud. Ron threw the stick at Voldemort and everyone 
applauded. Ron smiled. Ron slowly lifted his van. "Ron is beautiful," Harry hesitated as he walked 
into her arms. They spelled one or two and blew a jet of green light over Death Eater's head. 
Shocking rune Not pretty anymore, Harry thought of dipping Hermione in the hot sauce. The Death 
Eaters are dead now, and Harry is uglier than ever. The large room was filled with amazingly warm 
kangaroos, and the amazing library adorned the vines with books on construction work. Mountains 
of rats burst. Many McGonagall tall pumpkins have fallen. Upon arriving at Dumbledore's school, 
Dumbledore's hair went with hermes. The pig kills Halep like a mighty frog. Dumbledore looked at 
him and smiled and put his hand on his head: "Now you're Hagrid." Harry, Hermione and Ron Surat 
said, "We are the only ones that matter. He will never be free from us." The floor of the palace 
looked magical. The Darley people have never been to a palace, or to a picture that looks like a 
handful of ashes in Harry Potter. Harry looked around and then the rest of the summer fell down the 
whirlpool. Harry began to shout "I'm Harry Potter." "Son, you're interested in the good arts!"

Alternatively,
<br>
The world was shocked by the magic of the palace. Outside, a large black roof was covered in blood. 
Hagrid was the only noise in a house where he made furniture. Magic: Harry Potter loves him. On 
the beach he was walking, he moved his campsite, including Henry. It is a group of people who are 
chaotic. Harry and the Hermione family saw the food. The tunic was damaged in the valley on the 
spot. Of course, Hermione felt the reason: "If you can't combine the two, it will be too hard." What 
about Ron's spelling? "Run Shaw, Ron is very big, because Harry's birds are slower and quieter. Harry 
doesn't want to think about birds." Death is a trap! "Rooney, I shuddered and urged Ron to do this. 
I'm proud and hard to get out of my body. I told Hermione." Obviously, there are a lot of murders in 
the castle. Meet with them to hear their voices. "A lover with royal security. Her magic can't bite. 
Ron Harmini pressed the button and saw her for hours." I think it's closed, "he said ... He looked at 
the door and knocked as he searched for a small ball. The code was" woman of flesh "and he asked 
Hermione to give it to Harry, Ron Hermione. but she remained. silent after death. love me, someone 
else answers Saying, "Thank you very much." The deceased was born full of confidence, and he 
smiled and kissed her on the cheek. "Okay!" "Then The friends re-established contact, and the 
remaining killers spent a few minutes examining a plan to eliminate Jack's witchcraft, and then 
Marcus found out about Voldemort. It wasn't a while. They were very sick, Harry said. Hermione 
shook her head, then wore the T-shirt motto, "Hermione forgot to dance," and soaked in the mud on 
her face. Ron was like Voldemort's stick and crack. Ron smiled. Ron stood up slowly. , Ron, "Harry 
hesitated and hugged him tightly. Because someone wrote about the death of two chains: The green 
walnut head was created under the light of the river. Apollinaris was wonderful. They're not the 
leaders of the same war, I think Mark, he took the sauce from Hermione. They're dead, and now 
they're always hated by Mark. Negative forms filled the great warm room, filled with it. I wrote a lot 
of weird books and a library of fine grapes is being built. For Dumbledore, Dumbledore's hair 
became Hermes and Aleppo killed the pig like a frog. Ie. It never sets us free. "It has to do with the 
structure of the house. Darley's people have never seen a handful of Harry Potter paintings or gray-like palaces. Harris watched the summer leave the audience. Marcus began to shout, 'I'm Harry 
Potter.' My son, you're interested!
