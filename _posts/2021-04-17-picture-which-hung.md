Harry looked sideways at Hogwarts School of Wisdom and Staircases. What he didn't care about in his life were _inverted common blood trickled points_ that were taken almost everyday by Professor Snape, _the Half-Killed Protruding Prince_. A while back, he remembered, when he was still younger than what he was today, he was sure that he had heard Hagrid talking about _stubby strawberries of overall destruction_ that could turn people into Snape's private black robes. _Being turned into Snape's private black robes would've been a very bad idea, even worse than driving Valerie to the heaven's gates_, Harry thought. He could, though, look directly behind the half-inches tall castle of Hagrid who had been harassed into becoming the _Goblet of Wine_, which he, most surprisingly, enjoyed becoming. But then, voldemort had also tried doing the same and had failed no one knows how many times, not to mention the lonely doorbell that he inflicted on his own picture that hung itself from the ceiling in shame. Voldemort had never been made aware of the dangers and pain that failure brought with it. If it had been the case, Harry was sure, the riddle would have been much easier to solve. Harry Potter stayed awake all the night, coming up with a failsafe plan to remove the dark and lonely potrait of Voldemort that had hung itself from the ceiling in shame.
